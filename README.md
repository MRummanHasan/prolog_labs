**Running a Prolog program**

1. Creating a file containing the program
2. Saving the file
3. Loading the file into Prolog (called compiling, consulting, or reconsulting, the file in Prolog jargon)
4. Finally, calling some goal defined in the program

The version of Prolog we will be using is one which runs on a variety of different platforms and is called SWI-Prolog.
