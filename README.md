**Create a Prolog program.**
1. Double-click the Prolog program icon.
2. Use the File menu of the resulting window to create a new file and give it a name, with the extension .pl.
3. Enter the text of your file in the file window.
4. You save your file by using the Save option from the File menu on the menu bar at the top of the editorâ€™s window.
5. Make sure that you give your Prolog files the extension .pl .
6. You can copy text in the usual manner by using Copy and Paste from the Edit menu.
7. The same procedures work in the SWI-Prolog window; select the text to copy and use Ctrl-y to paste.

**Running a Prolog program**
1. Creating a file containing the program
2. Saving the file
3. Loading the file into Prolog (called compiling, consulting, or reconsulting, the file in Prolog jargon)
4. Finally, calling some goal defined in the program

The version of Prolog we will be using is one which runs on a variety of different platforms and is called SWI-Prolog.
